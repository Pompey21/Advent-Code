Hi! Welcome to my repository of solving daily challenges for this year's Advent Code!

Each day a new set of challenges is released - there are two challenges, and if you complete the first challenge you can progress to the second one!
For completing a challenge you receive a star :) 
There are 50 starts you can get to save the Christmass so good luck:)
